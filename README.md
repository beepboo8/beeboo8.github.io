 I want to raise awareness on Domestic Abuse by correcting misconceptions and helping people understand abuse and healthy relationships. 
 In this project, I will describe the signs of Domestic Abuse and ways to be safe.
I will also provide resources for people who are seeking support and for people who seek to help someone who are suffering from Domestic violence.
