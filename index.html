      <p class="sub-main">
        Domestic violence is a pattern of cruel behavior where a person uses different types of abusive ways to maintain power or control over someone. Age and gender does not matter. Anyone can become a victim and likewise, anyone can be an abuser. My mission is to bring awareness and alleviate domestic violence by presenting resources for individuals to learn, acknowledge, and help people who are suffering from domestic violence.
