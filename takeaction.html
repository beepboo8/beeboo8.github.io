      <h2 class="main-text">Emotional Support</h2>
        <div class="sub-main">You can provide essential emotional support by:
        <div id="sub-side">Acknowledging that their situation is difficult, scary, and brave of them to regain control from.
Not judging their decisions and refusing to criticize them or guilt them over a choice they make.</div>
        <div id="sub-side"> Remembering that you cannot “rescue them,” and that decisions about their lives are up to them to make.</div>
        <div id="sub-side">Not speaking poorly of the abusive partner.</div>
        <div id="sub-side">Helping them create a safety plan.</div>
        </div>

      <h2 class="main-text">Material Support</h2>
        <div class="sub-main">One of the most immediate ways you can support someone experiencing relationship abuse is by helping them with their material needs:
        <div id="sub-side">Help them identify a support network to assist with physical needs like housing, food, healthcare, and mobility as applicable.
Help them by storing important documents or a “to-go bag” in case of an emergency situation.</div>
        <div id="sub-side">Encourage them to participate in activities outside of their relationship with friends and family, and be there to support them in such a capacity.</div>
        <div id="sub-side">Help them learn about their formal legal rights through resources like Women’s Law, which provides information on domestic violence laws and procedures.</div>
        </div>
    
      <h2 class="main-text">Donate</h2>
