  <h2 class="main-text">Patterns of Abuse</h2>
  <div id="pattern">
    <img id="wheel" src="assets/power-and-control-wheel.png"><p id="note">Note: the Power and Control Wheel assumes she/her pronouns for the victim and he/him pronouns for the perpetrator, but the abusive behavior that it details can happen to people of any gender or sexuality.</p><a href="https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wheel-gallery/">Attached is a wheel libraray containing different languages</a>
   <div id="sub-side">What starts as simple verbal abuse and threats of violence, most of the time, progresses to assault, rape, and even murder.</div>
    <div id="sub-side">Illustrations of<strong> the power and control wheel</strong> and <strong>the post-separation power and control wheel</strong> developed by the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project offers a useful tool to understand the overall pattern of abusive and violence behaviors used by abusers.</div>    
    <div id="sub-side">Very often, one or more violence incidents are accompanied by an array of these other types of abuse. They are less easily identified, yet firmly establish a pattern of intimidation and control in the relationship.</div>
    <div id="sub-side">Also, bear in mind that children witnessing domestic violence progress to a cycle of violence where they may be future aggressors or victims of domestic violence out of its normalcy growing up.</div>
    <div id="sub-side">Most of the time, women feel like they cannot go anywhere, as they have no financial capability to do it; neither do they have the will power to pick up and run. They come to accept abuse as a norm, based on a cycle of psychological, emotional, physical, and financial abuse.</div>
    <div id="sub-side">There are many resources available for victims of domestic violence, including calling law enforcement and prosecution. Restraining orders can also be sort after, plus institutional support.</div>
  </div>
